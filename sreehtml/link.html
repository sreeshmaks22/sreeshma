					<ul>
						<li>
						lakme arganoil serum
						<ul type="circle">Serum foundations (also known as foundation fluids or skin tints) are currently one of the biggest trends on the beauty market.<br> The milky, oil- and silicone-based emulsions feel weightless and give the skin a beautiful, velvety finish without looking like makeup.</ul>
						</li>

						
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>
						maybelline dream liquid
						<ul type="circle">Dream Satin Liquid foundation + hydrating serum delivers the looks of completely poreless skin.<br> Achieve the look of completely poreless skin with a smooth airbrushed finish.<br> Lightweight and breathable, this up to 16-hour liquid foundation delivers cake-free, full coverage that moisturizes all day. Dermatologist tested.</ul>
						</li>

						
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>
						La Girl liquid foundation
						<ul type="circle">The verdict. The winner of this foundation battle in my books is the L.A. Girl Pro Coverage.<br> I do like the finish and the look on the skin a bit better. <br>It's a product that's more forgiving on dry skin, while providing a decent coverage and great staying power.</ul>
						</li>

						
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>
						wet and wild  foundation
						<ul type="circle">Wet and Wild has come far! This foundation is a medium coverage foundation that feels great on the skin. ...<br> it's a perfect foundation in my opinion,it's pigmented more like a medium coverage,<br>it's really cheap and you can find it everywhere.</ul>
						</li>
